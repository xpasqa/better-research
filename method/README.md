> **Creswell-first methodological reasoning for Better Research**

This folder is the methodological decision layer for Better Research. It helps an AI agent reason from a research problem to an appropriate research approach, design, and method without jumping directly to a familiar statistical technique or qualitative procedure.

The primary methodological anchor is:

**Creswell, J. W., & Creswell, J. D. (2023). _Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods Approaches_ (6th ed.). SAGE.**

Better Research treats Creswell & Creswell as the default framework for **research-design reasoning**. More specialized methodological literature is still required when a study moves into technical procedures that Creswell introduces but does not develop in specialist depth.

## Core rule

Do not begin with a method.

Begin with the research problem.

The AI may **recommend** a methodological path, but it must not silently convert that recommendation into a final research decision. Final methodological judgment remains with the researcher.

## Creswell-first, not Creswell-only

Creswell & Creswell provide the organizing framework for the relationship among philosophical assumptions, research approaches, research designs, and research methods. The book emphasizes essential features of research design rather than attempting to be a complete specialist manual for every technical method.

Therefore:

1. Use Creswell first to decide the **architecture of the study**.
2. Use specialist methodological sources to decide **technical implementation** when needed.
3. Never use a specialist technique to retroactively invent the research design.
4. Record any methodological departure from this framework and justify it.

## Human control

The purpose of this folder is not to make methodology automatic. It is to make methodological reasoning explicit.

AI should help the researcher expose assumptions, compare plausible designs, detect methodological mismatch, maintain consistency, identify evidence still required, prepare checkpoints, and draft the method section only after decisions are traceable.

The researcher remains responsible for the final methodological judgment.
